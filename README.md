# Perceptron
Simple Perceptron implementation

An implementation of a simple perceptron, based on the tutorials ([1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntKn5TPHHAk&t=870s) and [2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGxIcDjPzac&t=1183s)) from [The Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/user/shiffman) by [Daniel Shiffman](http://shiffman.net/).

Some parameters in the implementation have been intentionally altered to enhance the experience of watching the algorithm work, by slowing it down.

The legend on top/left corner displays the following information:
- The weights values
- The user defined line equation (blue)
- The line equation "found" by the algorithm (red)
- The frames/second
- The number of iterations the training algorithm has been executed
- And the runtime
